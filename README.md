# evolutionary-coin-change-c
This C project solves the coin change problem using evolutionary algorithms such as genetic search, hill climbing, and hybrid strategies. Developed as part of the Introdução à Inteligência Artificial course at ISEC, it explores metaheuristic optimization through population-based and local search techniques.
